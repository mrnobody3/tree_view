Welcome to your awesome Vite project! Vite is a fast frontend development tool that supports modern JavaScript features out of the box. This project requires some dependencies to be installed before you can start the development server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Running the Development Server
